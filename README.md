# JavaScript Fundamentals Project

This project covers the core fundamentals of JavaScript, including scripting and front-end programming concepts.

---

## Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- JavaScript runs in every browser without setup.
- It powers interactive web pages, animations, apps, and even servers (via Node.js).
- Itâ€™s versatile and easy to start.

---

## How to run a JavaScript script
- **In browser:** Include with `<script src="file.js"></script>`.
- **In Node.js:** Run with `node file.js` in terminal.

---

## Variables and Constants
- `var`: function-scoped, older, can be redeclared.
- `let`: block-scoped, modern, can be reassigned.
- `const`: block-scoped, cannot be reassigned.

Example:
```javascript
var x = 1;
let y = 2;
const z = 3;
